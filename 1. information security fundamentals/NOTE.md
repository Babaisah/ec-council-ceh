information security 
	this is a state wellbeing of information and infrastructure in which the possibility of theft, tampering and disruption of information is low or tolerable 
	[is the wellbeing of information in which the possibility of theft, disruption and tampering is low or tolerable]

Elements of security
Confidentiality : ensuring that only authorized users can access the system (encryption, access control )
integrity : ensuring that the information stays accurate as possible and is not tampered with (digital certificates, hashes)
availability : ensuring that information is available when needed and in the right state (backup servers, authorization)
non-repudiation : ensuring that users cannot deny their actions (digital signature )

Security challenges 
BYOD policies 
compliance to government laws and regulations 
difficulty in centralizing security in a distributed computing environment
relocation of sensitive data from legacy data centers to cloud without proper configuration 

Motive goals and objective of security attacks 
Attack = method + motive (goal) + vulnerability
	motives 
		disrupting business continuity
		manipulating data 
		financial benefits (to the attackrs)
		causing financial loss (to the victim)
		reputational damage 
	Vulnerabilities
		human factors 
		misconfiguration 
		accidental leak of sensitive information 
		outdated servers and digital infrastructures
	method
		social engineering
		web app pentesting
		network pentest

		Types of attacks
			Passive :
			 this does not include tampering with the data/information , it more of monitoring and gathering information. e.g sniffing, eavesdropping, dumpster diving, key logger.
			Active attacks :
			 this includes tampering with the data and infrastructure such as network and servers. e.g sql injection, Ddos, xss, man in the middle
			Close-in-attack :
			 this attack includes getting in close physical proximity with the target in order to modify,
			 gather or disrupt access to information. e.g social engineering such as eaves dropping  
			 shoulder surfing, insider
			 Insider attack :
			  this includes abusing privilege to violate rules and cause threat to the organisation. e.g keylogger, theft of physical devices and documents .
			Distribution attack :
			 this inludes attacking(tamper, modify, exfiltrate)  information in transit 
	Security Attack Vector 
		Cloud computing threats : most organisations store sensitve data on the cloud, this poses as a threat because the servers are 100% in their custody and the physical servers can be attacked
		Advance persistence technique : this is an attack focused on stealing from victims without the user being aware of it
		viruses and worms (viruses need vectors/host to leach on and survive | worms are standalone sofwares )
		ransomware: restricts access to information and demand a ransom for access
		Botnets
		Web application threats
		IOTs

information security laws and regulations
	PCI-DSS
		Payment card industry data security standard
			this law/ regulation applies to all organizations that handle card informations 
		standard
			build a secure network 
			maintain a vulnerability management program 
			protect the card holder information
			implement strong access control measures
			maintain an information security policy
		failure to meet up with these standards will get the privelege of processing card details revoked
	iso 1ec 27001:2013
		specifies the requirement or establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system within the context of the organisation
	HIPAA
	 Health insurance portability and accountability act 
		This applies to health organizations and organisations that store health informations, its primary goal is to protect patient data
	SOX 
	sarbanes oxley act
		This standard was designed to protect investors and the public by increasing the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosure 
			this standard has 11 titles 
	DMCA 
		Digital milenium copyright Act
	FISMA 
	FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT 
		This framework ensures the information security control over resources that support federal operations (united state) and assets
	GDPR 
	GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION 
		this is a privacy and security law created by the eu to protect user information.
