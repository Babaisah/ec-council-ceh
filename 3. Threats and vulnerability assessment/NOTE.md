		theft
		degrading performance 
	Components of malware :
		crypter
		downloader
		dropper
		exploit
		injector
		obfuscator
		packer

			-  TROJAN
				- This is a type of malware that disguises to be legitimate.
				how to create a trojan
					tools: 
						darkhorse trojan maker 
						trojan horse construction kit
						senna spy trojan generator 
						batch trojan generator
						umbra loader - botnet trojan maker 
						theef RAT trojan  : used to create remote access trojan
			- VIRRUS
				- This is a self replicating program(malware) that produces its own copy by attaching itself with another program. -- needs a vector/host for distribution 
				VIRUS LIFECYCLE :
					Design
					replication
					launch
					detection(ioc)
					incorporation(into antivirus)
					execution of damage routine
			TYPES OF VIRUSES
				system or boot sector virus
				file virus
				macro virus
				encryption virus
				webscripting virus

			VIRUS MAKING TOOLS
				DELME'S BATCH VIRUS
				BHAVESH VIRUS MAKER SKW
				DEADLY VIRUS MAKER
				SONICBAT BATCH VIRUS MAKER 
				TERABIT VIRUS MAKER 
				ANDREINICK05'S BATCH VIRUS MAKER
				JPS VIRUS MAKER (impp)
	-RANSOMWARE:
		This is a type of malware that restricts access to a computer system's files and folder> e.g 
	- Worm
		 malicious program that independently replicate , execute and spread across the network. (doesnt require a host or human interation)
		Creating worms 
			tools
				internet worm maker tool
				batch worm generator
	-rootkit
		these are programs that hide their presence as well as the attackers activities . in most cases it hides in the root partition of the computer to give the attacker root privileges, this servers as a backdoor for the attacker. this can be mitigated by using rootkit revealer 
	-PUA (POTENTAILLY UNWANTED APPLICATIONS )
	-ADWARE  software that generates unsolicited adverts 
	-spyware : this is a type of malware that spies on an endpoint
	-Keylogger : this is a spyware that record every keystroke on an endpoint
	-botnet : a collection of compromised devices to perform distributed attacks e.g Ddos attacks
	-fileless malware : resides in the Ram , this type of malware is stealthy in nature and hard to detect. 
- VULNERABILITIES
	  these are weaknesses or flaws in a system that can potentially  grant access to threat actor
	  CLASSIFICATION
		  misconfiguration 
		  default installation (password)
		  buffer overflow
		  unpatched servers
		  design flaws
		  os flaws
		  application flaw
		  open services(ports )
		  zero day
	  NEWORK SECURITY VULNERABILITY
		  TCP/IP VULNERABILITY
		  NETWORK DEVICE VULNERABILITY
		  USER ACCOUNT VULNS
		  NETWORK DEVICE MISCONFIGURATION
		  UNWRITTEN POLICY
		  LACK OF AWARENESS
